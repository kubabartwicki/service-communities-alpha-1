      <p>Anyone can run a service community. <a href="/service-manual/communities/service-communities">Learn more about service communities</a> if you arenâ€™t sure if you need one. </p>
      <p>This guidance helps facilitators and members of service communities develop their own by showing how others have done it before. You can help us keep this guidance up to date by <a href="mailto:service-communities@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">sharing the outcomes</a> you have achieved in your own service community.</p>
      <p><a href="/blog">Service communities in government</a> is a cross-government blog where facilitators and members of service communities share experiences and ideas.</p>

      <li>Think about who needs to be involved. Include people from policy, operations and digital, and anyone else that helps to shape the service across all level of seniority</li>
      <li>Articulate why you need a service community. Your proposal should include the problems a community will focus on and the departments likely to be involved</li>
