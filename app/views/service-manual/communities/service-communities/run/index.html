      <p>Service communities enable cross-government collaboration by making it easier for people to work together on an end-to-end service. Anyone who works on an end-to-end service with a complex user journey can run a service community.</p>
  
      <p>This guidance is based on how existing service communities have developed. Use it to learn how to develop your own or to decide what to do next. You can help us keep this guidance up to date by sharing the outcomes you have achieved in your own community.</p>

      <h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start a community</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Email the service communities team</a> if you are thinking of starting a service community</li>
        <li>Create a proposal document. This will help you articulate why you need a service community</li><li> Think about who needs to be involved. Include people from policy, operations and digital, and anyone else that helps to shape the service </li>
      <li> <a href="#">Check which communities exist already </a> to ensure that you are not solving the same problem as someone else</li></ul> 
      <h2 id="understand">Understand and agree on the scope </h2>
      <ul><li> Create a service landscape. This will help you get a common understanding of the problem space and the scope of your community</li>
      <li> Agree on the terms of reference. This articulates your community objectives and ways of working </li>
      <li> Set up communication channels, so that you can stay in contact with your community. Make sure these channels are inclusive and accessible to everyone </ul>
      <h2 id="work-together"> Work together to develop your community </h2>
      <ul><li> Agree a common language in your community, so that you are all referring to the same thing when talking about your service</li>
      <li> Create a step-by-step to help simplify the user jouney on GOV.UK </li>
      <li> Get an understanding of what everyone is working on now and in the future, so that it is easier to plan work across departments</li>
      <li>Create a community backlog based on your community objectives, so that you can track your progress </li>
      <li> Create a set of community personas so that the community agrees on who their users are </li>
      <li> Share resources including research and performance data, so that you can understand how the end-to-end service is used </li>

      </ul>
