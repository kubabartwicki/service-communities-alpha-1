<p>A terms of reference document was originally drafted in the start a business community, but has since been used in a number of communities. It’s a document that helps legitimises the community and it’s way of working, making it easier to for senior stakeholders to get bought into community work. </p>

<p>In the the start a business service community <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IEWt7s5f9Homj1txcLuq12fTvkwphitbFB0glyacZMo/edit"> terms of reference</a>
it specified the principles that a service community will adhere to. Such as creating a user centred focus across departments. </p>

<p>It detailed the roles and responsibilities within the service community, including appointing a facilitator and sponsors.<br/>
Further to this, it outlined the logistics such as when meetings will take place, and how the community will share information and resources.</p>

<p>A draft of the terms of reference was then shared with all of the start a business community to comment and iterate on. </p>

<p>By creating a terms of reference the start a business community agreed how they would work together. Agreeing the terms of refrences demonstrates memebers committment to the service community and it's way of working. </p>
