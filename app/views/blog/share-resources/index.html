<p>Sharing resources and information, and involving other service community members in your research, can lead to savings and extra knowledge across the service community. Members may gain access to information and insights that they would not otherwise have been able to seek out or create. </p>
  <p>In the start a business service community, Companies House invited other members to use their user research sessions to test elements of the end to end journey that were beyond their own immediate responsibility. They also invited other members to contribute questions for research.</p>
  <p>Sharing the research meant that community members gained insight into the wider user journey. It meant that governemt saved time and money by answering multiple departments reserch questions in one session. </p>
