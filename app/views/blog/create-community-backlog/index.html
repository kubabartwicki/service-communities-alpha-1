<p>Creating a community backlog gives community members tasks that can be tracked and measured against community objectives. Start a business community <a href="https://trello.com/b/XdXGA9mx/start-a-business-service-community">uses a backlog</a> to help them keep track of the work theyâ€™re doing.</p>
<p>To create their backlog, start a business community ran a prioritisation session. Individual and departmental priorities were captured. People were asked to consider the end user and the whole service when thinking about these activities.</p>
<p>These priorities were played back the group, and were mapped against the impact and effort of the activity. The dependencies and blockers were captured,  items that were too difficult were placed in the car park. </p>
<p>The group prioritised the mapped activities and assigned owners and potential delivery dates. This was all captured in Trello, which formed the community backlog.</p>
<p>Creating a community backlog articulated the things that the start a business community jointly wanted to achieve. It meant that people could see things moving through the backlog into the done column, ensuring that the community were continuously developing and delivering. </p>
