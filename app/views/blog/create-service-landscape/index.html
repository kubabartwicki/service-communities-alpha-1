<p>A service landscape is a tool used to map all of the guidance, transactions and services that are involved in delivering an end-to-end service. </p>

<p>The start a business service community <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p2arUJhSZohLSiI_W0uZqBOPNO7deuDmdjjvleqU1Qs/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102778219909388802561">mapped out the steps involved in starting a business in the UK</a>. This included things like which department did what in the process and what the user was required to do at each stage. It also showed the channels departments used to deliver each part of the service. </p>

<p>The mapping took three workshops to complete. The first captured the high level journey. The second workshop specified the names of transactions and guidance. The final workshop refined the service landscape and ordered it in the correct timeline. </p>

<p>The service community used the service landscape to spot knowledge gaps and recurring issues. Using the map the start a business service community were able to identify opportunities for improvement and areas to prioritise. </p>
