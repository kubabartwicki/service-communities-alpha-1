<p>A step by step navigation is a way of presenting end-to-end journeys. It groups existing guidance and transactions into a series of steps. <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/30/building-end-to-end-services-into-gov-uk/">This blog post explains more</a>.</p>
Many step by step navigations have now been created, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/learn-to-drive-a-car">Learning to drive</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employ-someone">Employing someone</a>.
The start a business service community used a workshop to identify potential step by steps, ranging in scope from 'setup a business' to 'choose legal entity'. They worked with the GDS GOV.UK team to 
plan potential step by steps and then used a further workshop to review and create prototypes.</p>
