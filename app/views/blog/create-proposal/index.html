<p>A clear proposal for the service community will help you to gather support and ensure everyone involved has a clear and shared understanding of its purpose. </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nAIaQikbojJf0CG2uzOopGae6E3YiaBiVdXoxdLArkE/edit">Defra collaborated with DIT to write a proposal</a> for the creation of an Import-Export service sommunity. They highlighted common issues for multiple departments working in the area, and how efforts were being duplicated and transformation opportunities missed. </p>
<p>They proposed a service community be used as a forum for collaboration, to be more efficient and effective. The proposal laid out how the service community would be delivery focused, sharing insight and knowledge, and avoiding creating new governance structures or slowing down other delivery schedules. </p>
<p>The proposal outlined potential service community outcomes, including supporting user-centred design, building relationships across departments and highlighting cross-cutting issues. It was distributed to relevant departments and teams, in advance of the service communityâ€™s kick-off workshop. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nAIaQikbojJf0CG2uzOopGae6E3YiaBiVdXoxdLArkE/edit">Read the Import-Export service community proposal</a>.</p>
